# React rules

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Use the Context API for state management when needed
- Use proper prop validation with PropTypes
- Use React.memo for performance optimization when necessary
- Use fragments to avoid unnecessary DOM elements
- Use proper list rendering with keys
- Prefer composition over inheritance
